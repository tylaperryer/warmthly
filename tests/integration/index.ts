/**
 * Integration Tests Index
 *
 * This file serves as a reference/index for all integration test files in this directory.
 * Test files are automatically discovered by Vitest, but this index helps with:
 * - Organization and navigation
 * - Understanding test coverage
 * - Maintaining test structure
 *
 * Note: Test files don't export anything - they contain test cases that Vitest discovers.
 * This file is for documentation and organization purposes only.
